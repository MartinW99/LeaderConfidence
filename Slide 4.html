    <p>Everyone in the group must indicate their decision in each round of the dot task. To do this, you must click the left or right button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

    <p>In every round, the leaders can choose to either look or not look at the others’ decisions.</p>

    <p>
        In the case they do not look at the others’ votes and give the correct response, they will be given an additional
        1(?) ECU in the round. Therefore, the leader will earn 20 ECUs and the other group members will earn 10 ECUs.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the case they look at others’ votes and give the correct response, a cost of 10 ECU will be imposed on their
        endowment. Therefore, the leader will earn 10 ECUs and the other group members will earn 10 ECUs.
