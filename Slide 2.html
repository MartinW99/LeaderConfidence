    <p>In this round, you will play this game against 20 people, with the following instructions:</p>

    <p>
        In this task, you are presented with 4 decks of cards. Each card you turn over has a high or low reward.
        You start this round with an endowment of &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; ECUs. The number on the card denotes the ECU attached
        to that card.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your task is to turn over 15 cards, with the goal of making the highest payoff.
        Each deck has a different distribution of rewards. To turn over the card, choose one of the two buttons below
        the cards. The reward upon turning over the card will be announced to you as soon as you make your choice, and
        will be used to adjust your endowment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that only your individual performance determines your payoff in this game.
        &lt;&lt;More on payoff â€“ random round? Average of all rounds?...&gt;&gt;.
        You will play 15 rounds of this game, of which 5 will be practice rounds, and thus will not be used
        to determine the payoff. The next 10 rounds will be used to determine your payoff.
    </p>
